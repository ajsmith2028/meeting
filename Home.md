# Group meeting schedule #
[Catalyst Design Lab](http://brown.edu/go/catalyst) (PI: Andrew Peterson)

**Fall 2020**  
Mondays, 2 pm - 4 pm  
BH 751

Everyone should sign up to give both:

1. A research update.
2. A review of any journal article of your choice, that you find important and interesting.

(Up to two talks per week.) Please indicate the title and DOI of the paper you will be discussing, and also put in a formal title for your research talk.

Let us know if you will not be attending any meeting in person and we will set up a zoom link.
