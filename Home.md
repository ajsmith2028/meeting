**Spring 2017**  
Thursday, 4-6 pm  
Arnold Labs 308A (Waterman St)

We will follow the format from last spring with a slight modification: everyone presents a very short talk (10 min) at alternating meetings, with a maximum of two slides. These talks are meant to be free form and not strictly research updates; you can talk about something you learned in the literature or an idea you had, for instance. You should select two items from the following list of categories and do one slide on each:

* Something you learned or can teach us (e.g., a new article you found, a different technique, a software trick, etc.)
* Something that went well (e.g., new data, a paper submitted or published, etc.)
* Something that you got stuck on (e.g., an unforeseen hiccup in lab work, etc.)
* An idea you had, or something you are excited to try (e.g., an idea for a new experiment, a faster way to do data analysis, ...)

Slides should be uploaded to the google drive by 3pm; we need a volunteer to bring the projector and laptop.

We will also have research updates from those who did not get a chance last semester, sprinkled into to these meetings as noted.
