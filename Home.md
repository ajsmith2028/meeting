# Group meeting schedule #
[Catalyst Design Lab](http://brown.edu/go/catalyst) (PI: Andrew Peterson)

**Spring 2019**  
Wednesdays, 1 pm - 3 pm  
ERC 225 (on Feb 13: ERC 250)


We will follow our annual spring format. Everyone presents a very short talk (10 min) at alternating meetings, with a maximum of two slides. These talks are meant to be free form and not strictly research updates; you can talk about something you learned in the literature or an idea you had, for instance. You should select one or two items from the following list of categories:

* Something you learned or can teach us (e.g., a new article you found, a different technique, a software trick, etc.)
* Something that went well (e.g., new data, a paper submitted or published, etc.)
* Something that you got stuck on (e.g., an unforeseen hiccup in lab work, etc.)
* An idea you had, or something you are excited to try (e.g., an idea for a new experiment, a faster way to do data analysis, ...)

Slides should be uploaded to the google drive by 3pm; we need a volunteer to bring a laptop.

We'll assign two groups before the first meeting; these are:

## Group A ##

Aaron Deskins

Cheng Zeng

Per Lindgren

## Group B ##
(Feb 13 and alternating Wednesdays)
